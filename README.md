CSV to JSON conversion breakdown
Component converter is handling conversion. Triggering the Conversion:

Automatic: If the "Auto Update" checkbox is checked, a useEffect hook listens for changes to the csvInput state. Any time you type into the CSV text area, it automatically calls convertCsvToJson.
Manual: Clicking the "Convert to JSON" button explicitly calls the handleConvert function, which in turn runs convertCsvToJson.
Inside convertCsvToJson(csv: string):

Input Check: It first checks if the input CSV string is empty or just whitespace. If it is, it clears the JSON output and stops.
Line Separation: The function splits the multi-line CSV string into an array of individual lines (rows) using csv.trim().split('\n').
Header Extraction: It assumes the very first line (lines[0]) is the header row. It splits this line by commas to get an array of column headers.
Row Iteration: The function then loops through the rest of the lines (from the second line onwards).
Object Creation: For each data row, it:
Creates an empty JavaScript object {}.
Splits the row into an array of values.
Iterates through the headers array and assigns the corresponding value from the current row to the object, using the header as the key. For example: obj[header] = value.
Array Aggregation: Each newly created object is pushed into a result array.
JSON Formatting: After processing all rows, the result array is converted into a nicely formatted JSON string using JSON.stringify({ result }, null, 2). This formats the JSON with an indentation of 2 spaces for readability and wraps the array in a parent object with the key result.
State Update: The final JSON string is stored in the jsonOutput state, which causes the output text area to re-render and display the result.
Error Handling: The entire logic is wrapped in a try...catch block. If the CSV is malformed and an error occurs during parsing, the output is set to "Error parsing CSV".

that array into a final JSON string for display.
